# Contributing

This is a copy of Google's internal code, intended to assist developers and
researchers who are interested in the implementation details of Google's
Private Compute Libraries. Changes to this code are made by Google first, and
then mirrored to this repository. External contributions are currently not
accepted. When/if they are accepted, you must sign the Contributor License
Agreement. See below for details.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your
contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your
contributions as part of the project. Head over to
<https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or
to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.
